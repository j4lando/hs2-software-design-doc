# CommsApplication SDD

## 1. Overview

`CommsApplication` is the Layer 3 Active component for the Comms subtopology. It manages the EnduroSat S-band radio operating mode — switching between low-rate omni telemetry (always available) and high-rate high-gain downlink (Standby/Downlink mode only). It coordinates `EnduroSatManager` (within its subtopology) and bridges to the `ComCcsds` pre-built subtopology.

## 2. Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Verification |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| HS2-COM-001 | CommsApplication shall maintain omni communications capability in all satellite modes | Inspection |
| HS2-COM-002 | CommsApplication shall activate high-gain downlink mode when commanded by SatStateMachine | Inspection |
| HS2-COM-003 | CommsApplication shall deactivate high-gain downlink and return to omni-only when commanded | Inspection |
| HS2-COM-004 | CommsApplication shall switch operating mode on command from SatStateMachine | Inspection |
| HS2-COM-005 | CommsApplication shall respond to health ping within the required deadline | Inspection |

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Component Type

Active component with internal hierarchical F' state machine (`Fw::Sm`).

### 3.2 Mode Interface

`CommsApplication` receives its operating mode from `SatStateMachine` via a typed port:

```fpp
sync input port modeIn: Sat.CommsModePort   # carries Comms.Mode
```

Mode enum (owned by this component's module):

```fpp
module Comms {
    enum Mode { OmniOnly, HighGainDownlink }
}
```

If the incoming mode matches the current mode, the handler returns immediately (idempotent).

### 3.3 Ports

| Port | Direction | Type | Purpose |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| `modeIn` | Input | `Sat.CommsModePort` | Mode command from SatStateMachine |
| `schedIn` | Input | `Svc.Sched` | Rate group tick |
| `radioCmd` | Output | `Fw.Cmd` | Configure EnduroSatManager operating mode |
| `pingIn` | `pingOut` | In/Out | `Svc.Ping` | Health monitoring |
| `logOut` | Output | `Fw.Log` | Event logging |
| `tlmOut` | Output | `Fw.Tlm` | Telemetry (current mode, link state) |

## 4. State Machine

`CommsApplication` uses a hierarchical F' state machine. Mode is the top-level state. A single `switchMode: Comms.Mode` signal defined at the top level is inherited by all leaf states.

```
OMNI_ONLY
  └─ ACTIVE          (omni link maintained; small telemetry packets only)

HIGH_GAIN_DOWNLINK
  ├─ CONFIGURING     (configure EnduroSatManager for high-rate downlink)
  └─ DOWNLINKING     (high-rate downlink active; requires AntennaPointing from AdcsApplication)

# Inherited by all leaf states:
on switchMode(Comms.Mode.OmniOnly)          enter OMNI_ONLY
on switchMode(Comms.Mode.HighGainDownlink)  enter HIGH_GAIN_DOWNLINK
```

## 5. Notes

- `HIGH_GAIN_DOWNLINK` requires `AdcsApplication` to be in `AntennaPointing` mode. `SatStateMachine` is responsible for commanding both simultaneously via the translation table — `CommsApplication` does not check ADCS state directly.
- `EnduroSatManager` is instantiated at the top-level topology (shared with `ComCcsds` subtopology); `CommsApplication` connects to it via the top-level topology wiring.
- Detailed high-gain link configuration and `EnduroSatManager` interface to be defined during detailed design.
