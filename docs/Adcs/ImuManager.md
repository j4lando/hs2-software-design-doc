# ImuManager SDD

## 1. Overview

`ImuManager` is the Layer 2 hardware manager for the IMU within the ADCS subtopology. It owns all bus communication with the IMU — resetting, enabling, configuring, and reading the device — and publishes raw angular rate and linear acceleration samples to `AdcsApplication` each rate-group tick.

`ImuManager` is a **Queued** component driven by `RateGroup1` (10 Hz). It has no satellite mode awareness; it runs its startup and read loop unconditionally once initialized, driven entirely by the rate group tick. `AdcsApplication` (Layer 3) is responsible for interpreting failures and, if necessary, commanding a power cut to the IMU via EPS.

The IMU connects to the flight computer via SPI or I2C (bus assignment fixed at integration time). All bus access goes through the Layer 1 `LinuxSpiDriver` or `LinuxI2cDriver` — `ImuManager` has no direct hardware knowledge beyond register addresses.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Component Type

Queued component with internal flat F' state machine (`Fw::Sm`). Has a message queue but no dedicated thread — executes on the `RateGroup1` caller thread each 10 Hz tick.

### 3.2 Parameters

`ImuManager` is not satellite-mode-aware and receives no mode commands. Configuration is entirely parameter-driven. Parameters are loaded from `Svc::PrmDb` in the `CONFIGURE` state. A parameter update at runtime sends a `reconfigure` signal, causing `ImuManager` to re-enter `CONFIGURE` from `RUN` without a full reset.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `GYRO_RANGE` | `U8` | Gyroscope full-scale range selection (device-specific register value) |
| `ACCEL_RANGE` | `U8` | Accelerometer full-scale range selection |
| `DLPF_CONFIG` | `U8` | Digital low-pass filter bandwidth setting |
| `SAMPLE_RATE_DIV` | `U8` | Sample rate divider register value |
| `RESET_WAIT_TICKS` | `U32` | Number of rate-group ticks to wait after issuing reset before proceeding |

### 3.3 Ports

| Port | Direction | Type | Purpose |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| `schedIn` | Input | `Svc.Sched` | 10 Hz rate group tick — drives the SM step |
| `busWrite` | Output | `Drv.I2cWrite` | Write to IMU register (reset, enable, configure) |
| `busWriteRead` | Output | `Drv.I2cWriteRead` | Write register address then read data (register reads in RUN) |
| `imuDataOut` | Output | `Adcs.ImuDataPort` | Publish raw angular rate + linear acceleration sample to AdcsApplication |
| `prmGet` | Output | `Fw.PrmGet` | Load parameters from PrmDb during CONFIGURE |
| `logOut` | Output | `Fw.Log` | Event logging (state transitions, errors) |
| `tlmOut` | Output | `Fw.Tlm` | Telemetry (SM state, consecutive failure count, last sample values) |

> **Bus type:** If the IMU is wired to SPI, `busWrite` and `busWriteRead` map to the corresponding `Drv.SpiReadWrite` port on `LinuxSpiDriver`. Port names remain the same; the driver type is determined at topology assembly.

### 3.4 Commands

`ImuManager` accepts no ground commands. It is not health-monitored. All recovery is handled autonomously by the self-healing SM or escalated via telemetry to `AdcsApplication`.

## 4. State Machine

`ImuManager` uses a single flat F' state machine following the `fprime-community/fprime-sensors` `ImuManager` reference pattern. All states are peers — no nesting. The SM is stepped by `schedIn` each tick.

```
RESET
  entry: write reset command to IMU power management register
         reset consecutive-failure counter
         reset wait-tick counter
  on tick → WAIT_RESET

WAIT_RESET
  on tick: increment wait-tick counter
           if counter >= RESET_WAIT_TICKS → ENABLE
           (no bus operations performed in this state)

ENABLE
  entry: write power management register to enable gyroscope + accelerometer
         (clear sleep bit, select internal oscillator)
  on tick:
    if busWrite OK → CONFIGURE
    if busWrite error → log WARNING_HI, increment failure count → RESET

CONFIGURE
  entry: load GYRO_RANGE, ACCEL_RANGE, DLPF_CONFIG, SAMPLE_RATE_DIV from PrmDb
         write gyroscope configuration register
         write accelerometer configuration register
         write DLPF configuration register
         write sample rate divider register
  on tick:
    if all writes OK → RUN
    if any write error → log WARNING_HI, increment failure count → RESET

RUN
  on tick: write data register address, read 12 bytes (gyro XYZ + accel XYZ)
           if busWriteRead OK:
             publish imuDataOut (angular rate, linear acceleration, timestamp)
             reset consecutive-failure counter
           if busWriteRead error:
             log WARNING_HI (throttled), increment failure count → RESET

# From any state:
on error signal → RESET      # self-healing fallback
on reconfigure signal → CONFIGURE   # parameter update path from RUN
```

**Error self-healing:** Any bus error from `ENABLE`, `CONFIGURE`, or `RUN` emits a `WARNING_HI` event, increments the `consecutiveFailures` telemetry channel, and re-enters `RESET`. The SM will retry the full startup sequence automatically on the next tick cycle.

**Repeated failure escalation:** `ImuManager` does not cut power to itself. If `consecutiveFailures` exceeds a threshold observable by `AdcsApplication` via telemetry, `AdcsApplication` is responsible for commanding an EPS power rail cut. `ImuManager` continues attempting self-healing until then.

**Parameter reconfiguration:** When `parameterUpdated()` is called (F' framework callback), `ImuManager` sends a `reconfigure` signal. If currently in `RUN`, this transitions directly to `CONFIGURE` — no reset required, preserving uptime. From any other state the signal is ignored (configuration will apply on next natural entry to `CONFIGURE`).

## 5. Notes

- `ImuManager` is instantiated inside the ADCS subtopology. Its `busWrite` and `busWriteRead` ports connect to a `LinuxI2cDriver` or `LinuxSpiDriver` instance at the top-level topology, depending on the IMU's physical bus.
- `imuDataOut` connects to `AdcsApplication` within the ADCS subtopology.
- `ImuManager` is **excluded from health monitoring** (`Svc::Health`). Only `AdcsApplication` is health-checked.
- The `Adcs.ImuDataPort` type (carrying timestamped angular rate and linear acceleration vectors) is defined in the ADCS module and shared with `AdcsApplication`.
- Specific IMU register addresses and power management register layout depend on the selected IMU device (e.g., MPU-6000 or equivalent); these are implementation details for the component's C++ source, not specified here.
- `RESET_WAIT_TICKS` must be set to cover the IMU's datasheet-specified reset stabilization time at 10 Hz tick rate (e.g., 10 ms reset time → 1 tick minimum; add margin).
- Deferred: exact `consecutiveFailures` threshold that triggers `AdcsApplication` to cut IMU power is a system-level parameter to be defined during detailed design.
